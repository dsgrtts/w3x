          What you're about to see will never be shown on CNN, CNBC, Fox, or any other major news network...
          It’s a <span class='nbsp'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <span class='highlight'>coveted 3 step system</span>  &nbsp; &nbsp; developed by this <b>former Wall Street trader -- Pete Renzulli</b>...
          And if you stick with me for the next few minutes…
          You’ll have the opportunity to take advantage of this system -- starting today.
          A system Pete has been showing to average at-home traders…
          Allowing them the opportunity to find predictable winners every single day.
          For instance…
          When Mark stumbled on to Pete’s coveted methods…
          He said…
        </p>

        <hr class='br'>

        <blockquote class='green'><span class='quotes'>&ldquo;</span><b>My weekly goal was $1000, yesterday I <span class='nbsp'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></b><span class='highlight clear'><b>made $7500 on 2 trades.</b></span>

          <i>The first trade I got in there was an obvious exit, it was at $2600, then the swing low | got in and I'm up to $2000, $3000.

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          And Tom, who said he’s made an incredible <span class='nbsp'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class='highlight'>"$20k+ in 2 days."</span>

          Like Marco, who says he "started with 8k at the beginning of November"…
          And about 1 month later on December 10th…
          Marco said he’s "at 18k now all thanks to [Pete’s] insights".
          <b>That’s more than</b> <span class='nbsp'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class='highlight'><b>DOUBLE than what he started with</b></span><span class='nbsp'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <b>-- And in just one month!</b>

        <ul class='xmarks'>
          <li>There’s no need for any fancy software…
          <li>No need to learn any confusing or boring indicators.
          <li>And no need to spend your entire day doing mind-numbing research.
        </ul>

        <p style='top:-20px; position:relative'>
          In fact…
          All you need to get started…
          Is a regular trading account…
          A basic laptop or computer - like the one you’re probably on now…
          And a "keen desire to learn" Pete’s 3 coveted secrets for becoming a consistent trader.
          Secrets Pete is so confident in...
          Back when Pete was funding new traders for his secret Wall Street Trading firm...
          Pete says:
        </p>

        <hr class='br'>

        <blockquote class='green'><span class='quotes'>&ldquo;</span><i>I could take just about any trader right off the streets...
        It didn’t matter what this trader’s experience or education level was...
        But, as long as they truly had the desire to learn and use my 3 coveted secrets….
        This new trader would get access to my account…
        Worth MILLIONS of dollars...
        Which gave them the chance to profitably trade millions of shares every month in my name.</i><span class='quotes'>&rdquo;</span>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Pete’s trading firm days are now behind him…
          So, he’s taking his knowledge and using it to help stay at home traders, break out of the rat race… Once and for all.
          And here’s the thing…
          You don’t have o be a fancy hedge fund manager…
          Or have a Masters in finance…
          And you definitely don’t need years of experience to use Pete’s system.

            Even the NASDAQ said:

            And worse yet…
            Right before this trade…
            Kohls had just released its 3rd Earnings Report of the year…
            And as everyone could ALREADY see from a mile away…
            Profits were down.
            And I mean REALLY down…

            But the stock kept traveling up…
            And Marty closed at $38.50 for a +$9.08 gain per stock.

            On $2,500 that’s about $770 bucks….
            On $5,000 that’s a $1540 win.
            Now compare that to the S&P which you’d get an average of 10%...
            IN A WHOLE YEAR!

            The key indication you want to see is the classic “break out”
            Meaning higher highs if it’s going up…
            Or lower lows if it’s going down and you’re shorting.
            Here’s how it works...
            See that first red arrow…
            That’s our first break out…
            Simply look for another big candle like the next one you see here...

            Here, take the stock QuantumScape…
            This company has been considered a pioneer in the electric car market…

            And this attracted HUGE investors like Bill Gates and Volkswagen.
            But after a DECADE of making promises...
            This battery company had some BAD news.
            As MSN, Motley Fool, NASDAQ and many more all reported…

            After a DECADE of Promises…

            Plugin your watch list from the night before.
            And compare it to the “Smart Money Playbook”...
            Which simply means…
            You'll look over the “order flow” of the stock from the last year, month, day, and hour.
            Here let me put this simply for you:<!--

            If you look at an overview of all market sectors…
            And all you see is green (meaning the stock is going up)…
            Then that means all of the “order flow” -- all of the Smart Money’ trades -- are bullish.
            So if the market movers are all buying…
            Being a buyer that day <b>lets you piggyback off of their movement.</b>
            It’s kind of like they say when you're cutting wood...

            I’m sorry but you’re gambling…
            And <b>we don’t gamble here…</b>
            But not saying you need to start with a $100,000 trading account either.
            Some are starting with $5 to 10k…
            And doing multi-day swing trades and 1-4 day trades each week.
            And depending on how much they start with…
            And how they do...
            <b>People are hitting their goal of making an extra 3k, 5k, 10k, 20k a month working with me.</b>
            And we're not talking about doing that in 200 trades a month.
            <b>Most people are doing 4-5 trades a week minimum.</b>
            And look at the big important question you are probably asking -- Will you actually get to work with me?
            And that’s a great question…
            And the community will tell you…

            You see, I’m not just one of those people who’s going to promise the world…
            Just to get everyone money.
            And I’m not going to outsource the important features to some middle man.
            I’m literally in there with you...
            And in a way, it’s a white-glove service.
            And I know it sounds hard to believe…
            And it’s naturally everyone asks...
            “PETE HOW DO YOU DO IT!?!”
            <b>Here’s the truth… This is easy for me.</b>
            Imagine that for decades…
            You managed your own trading firm…
            And managing risk for all 300 traders at the same time...
            Many of whom are calling you remotely from around the world --- just like the 30-day boot camp -- But here’s the big difference…
            They are asking you to trade 10s of millions of shares…
            All with your capital!
            That’s millions of your own money.
            As you can imagine that is a LOT of pressure.
            And I kept that up for decades -- but that’s behind me.
            Now for this group that you may join…
            For me, this is easy.
            And look, I was already going to trade anyway.
            It’s my favorite thing in the world to do and talk about…
            And the way I look at it, I’m very serious about your success…
            And my reputation relies on your happiness…
            And all the while you are talking about my bread and butter.
            You’re talking about my favorite thing in the world.
            This is fun for me!
            That said though…
            I have one stipulation…
            I WILL NOT let too many people in...
            Because I want to make sure every person in the group is personally taken care of by me…

            Most people try to look for stocks after the market opens…</b>
            <span class='underline green'>But that is insane!!
            That’s like changing lanes on a highway with your eyes blindfolded and one hand tied behind your back!</span>

            But you won’t need to do that anymore!
            Instead, just use these scans for 30 minutes the night before…
            So you can pick out a batch of about 10 stocks.
            You'll be set up with so many viable options…
            You won’t need to look for any new trades during the day...
